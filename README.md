#### Here's the long version

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Clinical Psychology at the University of California-Berkeley to study the human mind and how it responds to the world around us; seeking out new and innovative methods of discovery behind the ever-so-complex system of neurons, transmitters, and pathways. My undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Alabama and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the International Open University.

Prior to beginning graduate school, I spent nearly two decades as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, Startups, and Freelancing. I've created tools and companies to improve social media interactions and formed companies dedicated to Open Source; including OpenTeknik, the company responsible for the creation and ongoing maintenance of the Open Source Social Network. I worked as an engineer for Apple, transitioning the MobileMe platform to what we call iCloud today. My most recent professional project being a fullstack developer for DFN Freight Exchange, where I joined the team and spearheaded development of DFNX, their flagship freight exchange application built using TypeScript and Vue 3.

My work has ranged from software engineering, to fullstack, to ui design. I've worked as a consultant, contractor, and freelancer in all of these areas of expertise under my own LLC; building complex and robust web applications using JavaScript Frameworks. For the last year and a half, I've been focused on my education and learning new languages; taking a special interest in Golang for systems programming and HTMX, the Hypermedia library. Paired together, they do an extremely wonderful job of eliminating the bloat that SPAs carry with them when used for the wrong application.

I've also become increasingly fond of Astro and Neovim. 

I'm passionate about creating music, astronomy, space travel, psychology, and meteorology. I am the creator and maintainer of TornadoTrax, an application that shows the damage paths of US tornadoes between 1950-2022. It includes valuable analytics assisting researchers and enthusiasts alike.

I'm always open to new opportunities and love discussing technology. If you find me on Twitter, you'll see I am very much communicative and posting regularly; typically engaging in the memes from HTMX or ranting with other engineers about the common stuff you'd hear at the water cooler.
